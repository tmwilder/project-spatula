# Possible Data Sources
## Card Data
We need access to updated information on what all cards exist along with attributes, art, etc.. for searching and display.

These folks have an open bulk export API

## Match data
mtgo_scraper.py contains a prototype capable of going and getting Mtgo results from wotc official
We can probably get user submissions by scraping Goldfish - maybe we set something up to accept them too?

## Price Data
https://docs.tcgplayer.com/docs - pretty good pricing data available

MKM prices
